<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samuel Perez. I am a Computer Science major at The <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island</a>.<br>
        I am looking to obtain a Bachelors of Arts, and I plan to turn this passion into a profitable project that will change the lives of many.<br>
        I will one day become a figure for those finding themselves lost in the world of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
        Having been a child who found myself lost in the world of tech, I feel it is important to provide and instill knowledge in the future of our society<br>
        I felt that I only had myself growing up, and I do not want others to feel excluded.<br>
        <strong>We all have visions, and it is important for those visions to be accepted and encouraged</strong>.<br>
